## Introduction

### Goals

Community initiatives do not reflect the same value as other common organizational efforts. This results in community work often being undervalued by people, organizations, communities, and society. The Value working group aims to advance how we understand the value that projects can provide. 

### Purpose

Value group will develop metrics that, when measured, help make the impact of community work more transparent. 

### Who should join this working group?

All contributors are welcome to [participate](#participate) in the Value Working Group. The areas of interest include social value, organizational value, individual value, communal value and academic value.
