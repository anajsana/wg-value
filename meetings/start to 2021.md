        * Mapping between FAIR and CHAOSS 
        * Where the principles are already represented in CHAOSS metrics 
        * FAIR metrics get to the credibility piece but not really the impact piece of software 
        * FAIR may be more about things that ‘should be done’ not necessarily a measure of the ‘things are currently being done’ 
        * Perhaps the first hurdle is to consider how the FAIR captures this data. 
        * AI Sean: Take a look at one FAIR principle and consider how CHAOSS metrics could be used to help show the principle.

            * AI: Sean will work on the FAIR metric and put some text around it.
    * Proposed metric: Researcher reputation
        * [National Academies of Science, Engineering and Math Presidents’ Letter of Invitation and Guidelines](https://mailchi.mp/32e22d930e0b/nasem-request-for-university-presidents-engagement-open-scholarship-979572?e=e6cbf770a7)

    * Added Citation for Value Working Group in CITATION.cff file: 
        * CHAOSS Community, V. (2021). CHAOSS Value Working Group (Version 2021-03) [Computer software]. https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value
    * Open  RIT is creating using Giremorelab
            * Work in progress
            * Stephen is going to send an email in a week.
* **Researcher Reputation is a Metrics Model **
    * Includes FAIR metric
    * Includes Academic Impact Metric
    * Likely includes other CHAOSS Metrics
* Metric Model Process: Generally, working groups that exist will arrive at collections of metrics that are models. These models we propose will be reviewed by the App Ecosystem working group for consistency in form and structure. Content oriented discussions should, we propose, remain in the discrete working groups. 
    * We want to collect metrics already <span style="text-decoration:underline;">used in practice</span>, and present them as a “model”. A “collection” we call a model, or a “use case”, we call a model, etc.
    * For example, in the model for a “Researcher Reputation” model, the current metric “Project Popularity” is likely to be included. 
    * Metrics currently in development for the academic focus area are also likely to be included in a “Researcher Reputation Model”. 
    * GOOD EXAMPLE of what a model is for: [https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/issues/108](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/issues/108) (Business Readiness Rating for Open Source). 
* Value for a project to be part of a larger ecosystem
    * [https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/issues/154](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/issues/154)
    * Deriving value and providing value
    * Value the project derive from being part of echo system
        * D&I provide bading being part of LF project
        * Publicity
        * Close partners for collaborations
    * Project have access to lot of resources from foundation like LF, ASP
    * Similar metric already
    * **AI:** Nico to draft documents how projects drive value from the ecosystem.

* **Researcher Reputation is a Metrics Model **
    * Includes FAIR metric
    * Includes Academic Impact Metric
    * Likely includes other CHAOSS Metrics
* Metric Model Process: Generally, working groups that exist will arrive at collections of metrics that are models. These models we propose will be reviewed by the App Ecosystem working group for consistency in form and structure. Content oriented discussions should, we propose, remain in the discrete working groups. 
* Value for a project to be part of a larger ecosystem
    * [https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/issues/154](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/issues/154)
    * Deriving value and providing value
    * Value the project derive from being part of echo system
        * D&I provide bading being part of LF project
        * Publicity
        * Close partners for collaborations
    * Project have access to lot of resources from foundation like LF, ASP
    * Similar metric already
    * **AI:** Nico to draft documents how projects drive value from the ecosystem.

        This metric will be part of communal value.

Items from last meeting:

	Continue discussion: RIT OSPO notes from Stephen Jacobs



* Charter of Open@RIT: [https://www.rit.edu/research/open](https://www.rit.edu/research/open)
* [ https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DjjuEnfJKxfDFdktDoc_3Xx2ne8xp9fX/view ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DjjuEnfJKxfDFdktDoc_3Xx2ne8xp9fX/view)
* Goal is to develop a way of recognizing academic work differently for tenure
* Similar to [https://www.altmetric.com/about-altmetrics/what-are-altmetrics/](https://www.altmetric.com/about-altmetrics/what-are-altmetrics/)
* Idea is to get metrics on “how many people are using my open source work”?

    Some ideas: 

* Consider the Red Hat valuation as an analogy? Similar to GitHub acquisition by Microsoft. It identified open source as valuable in a way that was once not valued (where patents were the only metric for tech corps). 
    * Could be an argument of adoption, popularity, similar quantities we have. Then an ellipsis to the monetary value of corporate acquisitions.

* V-index 
    * Modeling the citation count 
    * Scientific software impact
        * These would be metrics that  
    * Identify funding needs 
    * Identify funded projects 
* Measure through stories
    * tell the stories of impact and value
* Set threshold for evolution metrics to count projects as:
    * 1. # of stars
    * 2. # of forks
    * 3. # of total contributors
    * 4. Commits (total #)
    * 5. # Pull requests opened
    * 6. # Pull requests closed
    * 7. # Issues created
    * 8. # Issues closed
    * 9. Project licenses
* There’s a translation of the word “impact” into specifics.
    * “Are you being cited” is the historical context 
    * “Are you critical” is an angle for funders
    * “Are you well-adopted” with the idea of an ‘impact radius’ -- is that used?
        * How is this measured? 
        * Revenue Generation
* In academic space, it matters how much money is generated more than building a community
    * There are also open source projects that make the lives of stakeholders in the university easier; better (example: Zotero solves citation management)
* New metric idea: Revenue tied to Project

        * AI: Kevin initiate the name change release
        * AI: Elizabeth get the data automation process going with Ria (CC Dylan and I plz ^^)
* New metrics up for discussion: 
    * Project Popularity - metrics was trying to do too much in one, so we have separated it into 2: Popularity #1 (development & usage):

RIT OSPO notes from Stephen:



* Charter of Open@RIT: [https://www.rit.edu/research/open](https://www.rit.edu/research/open)
*  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DjjuEnfJKxfDFdktDoc_3Xx2ne8xp9fX/view 
* Goal is to develop a way of recognizing academic work differently for tenure
* Similar to https://www.altmetric.com/about-altmetrics/what-are-altmetrics/
* Idea is to get metrics on “how many people are using my open source work”?


# November 5, 2020

**Agenda**



*  Evolution note: Code Reviews (i.e., Pull Requests) name changed to **Change Requests**
    * Check Value metrics for name consistency
    * **AI: Matt G** will take a look at the Value metrics so all of this is Updated 
* SCMS atomic metric development 
    * **AI Georg:** Change SCMS name to: Social Listening -- this was proposed Oct 8
        * +1 to Social Listening 
        * DONE: [https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/pull/120](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/pull/120)

        * Talk to Elizabeth about CHAOSS specific definitions -- this issue is the SC specific one
        * Objective: template out and add to metric spreadsheet
    * Asynchronous working structure may need some google docs or GitHub love.
    * Step one is defining the metrics in general using CHAOSS’ standard template, based off of Elizabeth’s current delineations for her implementation right? That’s already a tall task.
    * Get the ball moving on metrics 
* _Continued discussion_
* New metrics up for discussion: 
    * Continue popularity, which split into development & usage and reputation

### Metanotes from Popularity (original doc [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12zGoQHkyGQrjp_WuSA_fk_PvaJP7H0Zw_f3LtnrODZY/edit#heading=h.pizia4ivmh86))



* Where does this fit in our focus areas (and thus how are we framing this metric?)
* Individual value -- through the lens of getting a job? Could be a negative if you want to contribute and are intimidated by the quantity of contribution (and the rebasing needed)
* Organizational value is a good fit for the focus area because it’s a clear win. 
* Anecdotes? 
    * Corporate comparisons 
* Title?
    * Popularity is a lower value way of phrasing it. 
    * Install base could be a better metric.
    * How well **Liked** is the project? 
    * Usage vs likability
    * Proxy for market share?
* Reputation vs market share 
* Looking to split: 
    * popularity as reputation 
    * vs popularity as activity metrics (as proxy for market share) 
    * Project popularity (reputation) ****
    * Project popularity (development and usage) ****
        * Q: Same metric with different implementations OR two separate metrics?
            * A: two separate metrics (at least for now)
        * Matt B to draft reputation 
        * Duane to draft dev & usage (and others can weigh in)

-- Update  Oct 8, 2020 ---- 



* Reputation as a leading indicator (more about _who’s_ participating and _where_)
    * Stars and Forks on other repositories affiliated with an organization
    * Followers of developers/contributors (people follow the popular contributors, Blincoe, et. al, 2016) 
    * Social media reputation
        * Twitter Followers
        * Facebook Friends
        * Instagram Followers 
    * Public presence of developers/contributors (talks, blog posts, etc)
* Development & Usage as a lagging indicator (as a market develops, who has market share?)
    * At this point, comparative metrics about the project itself matter
    * The social prowess of participants is still a factor***

        	

* Could this metric also be interesting for other working groups?
    * Risk: does a more popular project (or one with a stellar reputation) become a target and draw unwanted attention from ne'er do wells? (as in, do people try to exploit and find security vulnerabilities more?)
    * Evolution: Project popularity over time seems like an indication of project maturity, so would this fit in there?
    * D&I: is the project’s popularity (or a core contributor’s reputation) adversely affecting contributions from underrepresented groups, or is it helping attract a more diverse contribution base?
    *

Agenda



* Social Currency Metrics System
    * **Trademark Issue**
        * SC.O is not planning to move forward with trademark until a future date when it’s settled for CHAOSS. Doing so would muddy the watters more. From SC.O’s side there are no issues with renaming, reframing, or remaking the SCMS in CHAOSS as long as the recognition for it’s origins is recognized as having come from SC.O, Venia and/or dylan.
            * “We stand on the shoulders of giants with this system - and in a way, you do too.” \

    * We chatted with Mike Dolan 
        * The recommendation is to use a different name in CHAOSS
        * SC.O remains in control of the SCMS brand
    * Solution: Rename SCMS in CHAOSS 
* UNICEF
    * Running and instance of Augur working with Justin Flory 
    * Working with the new focus area called social value

    * Digital Public Goods
    * Victor and Janice from UNICEF 
        * There should be multi-stakeholder alliance promoting open source, open data, open content
        * Let’s try develop a standard and if a technology achieves the standard then they can be classified as a digital public good 
            * Looked at CHAOSS metrics to assess the health of sample projects 
            * The process ended up being too involved (50 metrics) down to perhaps 9 indicators 
                * Working to streamline the process of vetting to determine a digital public good 
                * Making a vetting process that could be lower overhead that could potentially be sourced to a community 
        * Is it fair to say that there are two vetting processes
            * One lightweight
                * [https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/) 
                * Documentation - 
                    * Install and setup 
                    * Code of Conduct 
            * One more in-depth 
                * This is beyond the nine indicators 
                * All meet some basic criteria but there can also be a deeper dive that investigates projects beyond the nine indicators 
                    * The outcome is more opinionated reviews 
                    * This can give a higher level of understanding for the projects.

                * To me it sounds like a better format would be a public rubric setup with different levels and types of award based on sub-criteria rather than a rating system that ticks off boxes objectively? That way its not trying to get too granular in each specific area?
        * Social Value or Impact 
            * What is the level 
                * Product level 
                    * Privacy
                * A broader level of politics and government 
                    * Improving Democracy 
            * Should we focus on the implementation on the project -- how the project lives in the world 
            * Have to be careful to not be a watchdog for monitoring projects in both development and implementation 
* Dependencies and Ecosystem
    * I think that this conversation is going to land in Value 
    * [https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/issues/108](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/issues/108)

    * The categories enable us to not just collapse all dependencies into one type
        * We an help make better sense of the space 
        * We still need to learn how to rank within each category 
    * Measuring use within a category
        * CPU Load
        * Direct dependencies
        * Indirect dependencies
        * Developed a weighting matrix

Agenda



* Review and close [https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/issues/104](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/issues/104) 
    * No new information / closing
* Check in on discussion in [https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/issues/108](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/issues/108) 
    * Difference between Organizational Value and **Business Readiness **
        * Software could be ready to use, but could be not valuable for a given use case
        * The categories lack business value / relevance to the business challenge in it
        * These metrics/categories assess good software, but not clear in the value to the business
    * Duane’s take from the notes: 
        * My thinking here is that if there was a programmatic way to get at an approximate Business Readiness Rating for a given list of dependencies, you could inform several decisions around both adoption and investment.
        * The next thing I'd want to chase down is "What are the alternatives to this dependency?" I think we could get at that by looking at community trends and data from the package ecosystems, but I'm not aware currently of tooling that would answer the question.
        * However, the end state would be a report that shows Business Readiness Rating for my dependencies next to the best Business Readiness Rating for an alternative to the dependency. With that report, I could look for opportunities to move to better dependencies and do some analysis on the cost of switching. And if there doesn't appear to be any viable alternative for a dependency, that's strong signal that we should participate in maintenance activities.
    * Metric representing what? 
        * Not organizational value, but readiness to adopt a product 
    * Checking back in: Organizational Value is the focus group, and we’re commenting more on that 
        * This may be valuable if and only if the person assessing the technology 
    * Next steps? 
        * Need to understand what are the atomic qualities of this metric, but first: connect with the author.
            * Curious to hear about whos’ used it and their feedback so far (examples, anecdotes)
* Continue popularity: [Project Popularity](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12zGoQHkyGQrjp_WuSA_fk_PvaJP7H0Zw_f3LtnrODZY/edit)
    * **AI Matt B:** to draft Project Popularity (reputation)
    * **AI Duane:** to draft Project Popularity (dev & usage) (and others can weigh in)

            * What are the criteria used to judge digital public good
            * How does the organization catalog 
    * What’s our goal? 
        * NOT be a judge of social good, but an aggregator on ways by which organizations (quantitatively and qualitatively) measure social value
        * Identify organizations measuring this type of work

Agenda



* Touch base on where we landed with SCMS [https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/blob/master/focus-areas/communal-value/social-currency-metric-system.md](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/blob/master/focus-areas/communal-value/social-currency-metric-system.md) 
    * Reminder that this is moving toward a program, along with badging and community reports
    * Badging: Matt Snell can help shepherd the program along (under D&I)
    * Community Reports: Vinod to shepherd (consider adding Common?) 
    * SCMS: TBD - want to ask Venia and/or Dylan (under Value) 
        * Programs include definition of the ontology and the processes and systems that support them
    * So what is a program? 
        * A collection of metrics with process and systems (we should hold under CC / OSS licenses)
        * Point person 
        * Hosting 
        * Service
* Discuss progress on Social Value [https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/issues/107](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/issues/107) 
    * [https://socialvalueportal.com/what-is-social-value/](https://socialvalueportal.com/what-is-social-value/) (shared by Matt S)
    * [https://socialvalueint.org/social-value/what-is-social-value/](https://socialvalueint.org/social-value/what-is-social-value/)
    * [https://www.sopact.com/perspectives/social-impact-outcome-metrics](https://www.sopact.com/perspectives/social-impact-outcome-metrics)
        * What is social value? Social value is the quantification of the relative importance that people place on the changes they experience in their lives. Some, but not all of this value is captured in market prices. It is important to consider and measure this social value from the perspective of those affected by an organisation’s work.
        * Possible definition (georg, from link Matt S posted):  **Social value is the long-term wellbeing and resilience of individuals, communities and society in general.**
        * Possible Mission:** This program is committed to advancing the social value of the Internet (production of shared goods on the Internet). **
    * From Ford Foundation (refined through discussion in the call)
        * <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Social Value: Identify whether an open source project </span>reduces poverty and injustice, strengthens democratic values, improves health and mental wellbeing, promotes international cooperation, fosters economic equality, or advances human achievement. These goals are addressed in CHAOSS through support for the health and sustainability of Internet shared production communities, who create data, software, and information that advance these aims. 
            * Source: [https://www.fordfoundation.org/about/about-ford/mission](https://www.fordfoundation.org/about/about-ford/mission)
        * Notes: 
            * physical, political, legal, economic and environmental.
    * Our start:  
        * Does the project improve access for people?
        * Does the project improve justice for people?
        * Does the project improve equality of people?
        * Does the project improve equity for people?
    * 

Action Item



* **AI Georg:** Venia/Dylan on SCMS and consider commitment of shepherding it / feel like it’s a good strategy
* Separately discuss what a program means (CHAOSS Community Call)

Agenda



* CHAOSS D&I Reflection 
    * Ford Foundation - reflecting on our own D&I efforts / provides a use case and example of our work
* **FOCUS**: Continue on metrics feedback for this release 
    * SCMS (see below) 
    * New focus areas (previously agreed we’re happy about them [https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/issues/95](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/issues/95))
* Previous discussion (last week) 
    * SCMS review
        * Revised SCMS: [https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/issues/75](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/issues/75) 
            * The metric contains server open source concerns
                * There is a process component 
                * There is a data component 
                * There is a codex component 
        * CHAOSS is going to pilot the metric for the project. 
        * Question of the scale of complexity of this metric relative to others
            * 10+ discrete metrics to add up to this metric specifically 
            * We lean toward specificity and details, this one is composite in nature
        * Is a good step forward to ask what atomic metrics that are required in order to make this comprehensive metric understandable?
    * OPTIONS (all we can possibly think up to be comprehensive)
        * Reject as a candidate
        * Accept with annotation 
        * Accept as is 
        * Apply an “incubation” tag (does that exist)
        * Move it into the “Program” category and away from “Metric”
    * Side thought
        * SCMS includes ‘system’ in the title. Not a metric.
        * We do have other programs types that are *not* metrics: 
            * Badging program 
            * Health report program
            * SCMS as its own program?
* Takeaways: 
    * Release with some annotation 
    * By the next release
        * Include our Programs listed above on the site
        * Release the atomic metrics of SCMS 
        * Remove SCMS as a metric
        * Add a redirect  bn
        * Consider language across CHAOSS 
            * Atomic 
            * Synthetic 
            * “Incubating?” (might not be needed but worth thinking through)
            * Programs! That carry practices and processes 
    * Metrics history
    * Metrics program 

Consensus: 

We discussed during the meeting today that SCMS may be upgraded to a program because it is more strategy and process with a collection of metrics. It has "System" in its name.

It could be on the same level as `D&I Badging` and `Community Reports`. Here is a proposal to update the website:

                    * Current: Identify if a project is attentive to improving the lives of people beyond software. 
                    * Proposed: Identify the degree to which a project is attentive… 
* Social Value
    * How do we even begin to think about this? 
    * Who is the person who gets to define social good? 
        * We need to work with those who do social good to be representative.
    * One metric that could be low hanging for us: does the mission of the project explicitly target social good	
    * Pulling comments from the Ford Foundation 
        * Disrupting systems to advance social justice
        * Strengthen the Social Justice Sector
        * driving social justice and building movements across the globe.
            * Takeaways: deferring to organizations explicitly aligned to social impact.
    * Subcategories coming to mind: 
        * Social justice
        * Healthcare (think COVID work) 
    * Freedom of the license? 
        * FSF followers would believe copyleft would be an essential measure. AGPL the most.
        * [Matt B] Not pitching this specifically but it came to mind.
    * Point on this: 
        * Self-reporting on these metrics can be bad.
        * How do we ensure an organization looking to measure a group, not an group self-reporting.
        * When framing metrics, keep the measurer in mind as external to the project
* SCMS review
    * Revised SCMS: [https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/issues/75](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/issues/75) 
    * CHAOSS is going to pilot the metric for the project.

* Some notes and papers on large scale network analysis. This has general application to how we decide to operationalize networks. Some consider the network as between individuals in conversation, others as coordination requirements between developers. Two of them do analysis of the (human) language used in discussion, and identify where ideas first are observed in online conversations, then spread as “knowledge” in other threads. Others look at the interaction between individuals and artifacts like software (commits, pull requests, issues, documentation..)  
    * Goggins has been thinking about large scale network analysis for a while, and thinks this paper will help you think about different ways of thinking about networks.

Agenda



* Any items for discussion? Add them here: 
    * AP call came up -- network analysis 
        * Of what? 
            * To what ends? 
        * Vinod: of the Python ecosystem is curious
        * Conversation around what does that mean in practice? 
    * Raw metric vs synthetic metric specific.
        * Having metadata that connect raw metrics with synthetic could lead to offer a kinder user experience in the metric library. 
            * “This metric is made up of one or more raw metrics.” 
            * “This metric is used in multiple synthetic metrics that offer additional value.” 
        * Vinod mentions these as sub-metrics for a given metric.
        * Any takeaways? 
            * Think about the infrastructure of GitHub data into metric category. How do implement something like that/ 
    * Focus groups 
        * Matt G bringing up as important for categorization to avoid creating metrics for metric’s sake.
        * Focus area & what are the questions we want to ask within that space? 
        * Social media? Content? 
        * Determine the economics for participating in open source. 
        * If you find value from this set of data. 
        * Proposal (Goal -> Metric -> Questions approach)
            * Understanding external voice (maybe Reputation?)
                * Questions (that improve transparency toward those ends)
                    * How am I doing compared to my competitors?

                * Financial impact (how much money will it save? Cost? Worth?)
                    * Reduce developer time
* Metrics under review (see [PRs](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/pulls))
    * SCMS updates
        * The risk that remains here is that it is a big metric that can be overwhelming if someone lands on this as their first metric in the project. Matt G has a hope that we can scale it back and ensure it’s clear to use and we can point to its component parts. 
        * [https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/pull/76](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/pull/76) 
    * Share of Voice
        * (Matt B) Revised the draft - wrapping up a rewrite
        * Still a synthetic metric that points to component parts. 
        * Give a review without solving for aggregation.

Agenda:



* Check in -- any items for discussion? 
    * Matt G: Do we want to systematically approach target audiences (OSPOs/DevRel) to get a better handle on value.
        * Funding for professional survey
        * Still have funding through grants / still have the $ and can be aimed at ways of scaling the project effectively
    * Matt B: development of metrics -- what ones are valuable? 
        * Separately: the process by which those metrics find meaning in an organization
            * Funding could be used to find the “raw bits” of metrics used or the playbooks used by specific organizations. 
    * Idea: default cauldron dashboard for Value. 
        * Visualizations, descriptions, all exportable.
    * Goal: Have a great example, make it exportable, and a description of setting up your own
    * Focus Area:
* Working session - Issue/PR review:
    * [https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/pull/76](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/pull/76) - SCMS updated
        * Currently: in an archived folder (and needs to remain “in” CHAOSS)
        * For the GSoC project: Simplify the SCMS metric description. Pull out procedural details from SCMS description to the tool that is built for GrimoireLab. 
    * [https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/pull/77](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/pull/77) - reviewed --- notes in project
* Focus areas for Value WG
    * there is no requirement to have focus areas
    * Other working groups found natural groupings of metrics
    * We could have a grouping based on the audience:
        * Valuable to individuals, communities, or organizations.
    * We have a good proposal for focus areas or even changing to a more fluid way of describing how metrics can be used: [https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/issues/78](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/issues/78) “Focus area proposal: Internal vs External value”
    * King: differentiation of value between foundation and company
        * Please [open an issue](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/issues/new) and let’s discuss it further! 
* Conversation with Matt G on composite vs atomic metrics 
    * Certain working groups are inclined one direction or the other. 
    * “I don’t know if it makes much difference” 
    * Open to metadata that makes it clear when it’s one or the other

Notes: 



* Lawrence Hecht introduced himself
    * Working on TODO Group Survey
        * Why companies use OSS
        * What values they use
        * Developer velocity
        * Other OSS questions not related to OSPO
        * This year is the third installation of the survey:
            * [https://github.com/todogroup/survey/tree/master/2020](https://github.com/todogroup/survey/tree/master/2020)
        * VMware sponsors the survey this year to get a better data about what companies are perceived as good open source participants
    * Worked on TideLift survey
        * Why do people pick certain OSS projects
        * What are incentives to work on OSS
        * How many hours? What price?
        * May be running this kind of survey again.
        * Included a question for CHAOSS: -- is an OSS project current (must have update in last three months)
        * Report: [https://blog.tidelift.com/the-key-benefits-of-a-managed-open-source-approach](https://blog.tidelift.com/the-key-benefits-of-a-managed-open-source-approach)
    * Harvard and Linux Foundation were supposed to launch a very detailed survey about OSS development. Not shared questions yet.
        * Survey work press release: [https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press-release/2020/02/the-linux-foundation-and-harvards-lab-for-innovation-science-release-census-for-open-source-software-security/](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press-release/2020/02/the-linux-foundation-and-harvards-lab-for-innovation-science-release-census-for-open-source-software-security/) 
        * Renew GitHub 2018 survey
        * Renew the BlackDuck surveys
* Vinod introduces his work
    * Ran a survey targeting executives (CIO/CTO)
    * Asked what value they derived from open source
    * Sent out 500 requests (January), received 15 responses (end of March)
    * We reviewed the questions that Vinod used in his survey
    * Q: why did you make the survey and for whom? 
        * For his personal research for PhD
    * Thoughts from Lawrence:
        * Go through the survey and consider which ones got responses 
        * Prepopulate a follow up survey with this information, ask “did anything change”?
        * Figure out what’s interesting and start over 
        * Maybe going too high up in the food chain 
    * Thoughts from Sean:
        * Maybe use sliders for easier to respond (fewer options)
    * Thoughts from Matt G: 
        * The research is to support the CHAOSS Value WG. The question of how value is calculated and expressed is “the holy grail” of metrics. Having the answer “no one does this” is a ground truth and provides validity that we need to solve this issue.
        * 
    * Thoughts from Matt B: 
        * For C** I try to ask fewer than 10 questions with 3 or so options or sliders.
        * Multi-prong approach -- if we want to reach out to CIO, partner with those with CIO access already. There is those with CIO and C*O access through other communities (CTO Advisor and Enterprisers Project).
    * Lawrence:
        * Did panels in the past. Select a few very good people 
        * Have a good screening question -- good to filter out who is replying 
        * Tag the surveys to know where the response came from
            * Note when vendors email out a survey (unique tracker / copy) 
            * Unique parameters from 
        * Circulate widely -- newsletters, announcements, share with other groups
        * If you have the budget: combine with data from other source, give out incentives
        * Recommended minimum audience = 30,000 people see it. 25% click, of that only 25% complete.
        * General topics or vague ones don’t inspire participation.
* Q: What metrics are important to collect through survey (qualitative) instead of by observation?
    * How is that done?
* Lawrence’s understanding: 
    * How funding open source communities -- has a lot to do with hiring, recruiting, and supporting developers in a community.
    * Different than funding open source maintenance 
    * When asking OSPOs - some operational, some license compliance (big cost center), attempts at measuring innovation, connection to revenue generation (“impossible to measure -- you’ll get answers but they’re impossible to measure”) 
    * Business leaders and department leaders measure value in different ways
    * Lawrence has Software Engineering management KPIs that are used to justify OSS use (higher quality code, less defects, etc..)
* Goal: 
    * What can we do to tweak and rerun the survey with a higher response rate
* Matt B
    * Having honest conversation are very important make sure we are fully understanding the context we work in: What is VALUE?
    * Much of the metrics used in the past have been little aligned between the business leaders and the open source communities
    * Hopes to collect metrics that people use to effectively get funding for their open source work and justify that work; the metric is measured by its effectiveness in that regard; a metric is not required to be rigorously tested, just effective
* Sean: 
    * Measuring innovation coming back. 
    * Standard way (industry wide) is patents. 
    * Another way that’s more common is products -- Product Reallocation -- how many are coming to bear (bare?) and how many are falling out of the market
* Lawrence’s response: 
    * Release cycle / speed of releases
    * Product updates and further 
    * One concrete one: how often is a product page for XYZ company being updated (measured by web crawlers) can be a rough estimate. 
    * In OSS: there are releases, versions, integrations. All could be measured, but not necessarily of value. These could be more health & sustainability perspective rather than value itself.
* Bimodal split when it comes to measurement of value. 
    * Business executive audience 
    * Software engineering audience
        * Everyone will agree that Security is important. These audiences may not agree on how that is measured or what it looks like. 
            * Ex. “How essential is application security” connected to “out of date dependencies” ? 
    * Can we have metrics that have a compelling side to engineers as well as business leaders?
        * How can the same metric be communicated effectively to different audiences, make sense to the audiences, and compell actions
* How is headcount calculated? FTE (full time equivalence) = headcount
    * People who care about that are in software and technology business. (Ex. Intel, VMware)
    * Google, with thousands of devs are much more likely to be looking at quality metrics and FTE costs of behavior 
    * If P&G with hundreds of dev in 50 divisions, not going to consider FTE as powerful of a value
* Georg (in chat): Today’s meeting has been super awesome in building out our shared understanding of what Value in Open Source means! Thank you everyone who has chimed, asked questions, and shared experiences.
*  


# March 26, 2020

Q: Is there value in combining the Value WG with another WG? 

A: As of today, we’re seeing if it’s valuable on its own. Refactoring to meet a specific and reasonable need. (Note from Matt B)

Notes: 



* Introductions to a newer-ish group of faces 
* Open questions: 
    * Connection between CHAOSS and OSPOs and TODO Group 
        * YES! They do a fantastic job of codifying how that works. 
    * Not metrics for metrics sake, but bringing them all the way through to usage and meaningful impact. 
        * D&I using badges
        * Risk in Augur [https://github.com/chaoss/augur/tree/dev](https://github.com/chaoss/augur/tree/dev)  
* Working toward a holy grail of open source -- how do you measure value (financially)? 
    * “Everyone else is doing it” as a default 
* Ideas: 
    * Value prospectus dashboard -- standard way to present value to investors
        * Dependencies, usage, risk, 
        * Modelled after a financial prospectus document (standard legal document for investors)
* Redesign and shift in mission happened recently! See [https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value) now for the latest. 
* Mission: Value group will collect all known metrics that, when measured, help secure funding for community work. These metrics must be, at furthest, one step removed from a direct financial incentive to invest.
    * No concerns off the top of anyone’s head. 
* TODO: look through past metrics and ensure they find a good home. 
    * That list; [https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/tree/master/metrics/archived](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/tree/master/metrics/archived)
    * These are released metrics --- what does that mean for us?
        * Once we release a metric, we can evolve it or change it, if we take it away it’s a breaking change. 
        * Do we need a deprecation notice? 
        * Is there a way to trace usage (dependencies)? 
            * We don’t knock on every door 
            * But want to learn about adoption
            * Feedback windows are great
* Process to move forward: 
    * Identify Value Focus Areas (WG Goals)
        * In the meantime, focus on alignment to mission of financial incentive to invest
    * One thing to consider is that some existing metrics are focused on contributor looking for value. The consideration is whether the contributor is a rational economic profit-maximizing actor. There may be other aspects a contributor is valuing about the project like code quality, bus factor, good community interactions. We may consider metrics supporting the contributors looking to live off of open source contributions.
* Job marketing: [https://www.battery.com/powered/boss-index-tracking-explosive-growth-open-source-software/](https://www.battery.com/powered/boss-index-tracking-explosive-growth-open-source-software/)
* _copied from the chat [King]: _value is very interesting area  . lot of company consider value=money. but LF may find a method how to find out the value in developer.may be metrics value can help the developers in someplace.
    * [King]:Is it possible to measure past successful projects, interview their contributors, what value do they think after the project is successful
    * [Georg]: Excellent idea. Doing such a survey is possible. Would you ask the contributors what metrics they looked at? 
* Vision to get there? (To be discussed)
    * Early ideas: 
        * outreach and book club
            * Everyone pick an influential site or book on OSS metrics
            * Open a PR for each metric that meets the above criteria
            * List:
                * Jono Bacon Art of Community 
                * Mary Thengvall’s the Business of DevRel
                * Jono Bacon People Powered
                * Karl Fogel Producing Open Source Software 
                * TODO Group’s metrics guide 
                * Examples used in keynote slides from top conferences
                    * Past Community Leadership Summits
                    * Past Open Source Summits

* Maybe look at metrics at a higher level -- we achieved a point of maturity -- look at metrics across working groups -- we need to appreciate what we have -- ecosystem perspective (part of Armstrong’s research)
    * Focus on:
        * OpenStack Ecosystem
        * Linux Foundation Ecosystem
        * Apache Ecosystem
    * Socio-technical aspects
        * The way people communicate and coordinate and work together
        * Already looked at the D&I aspects (using the CHAOSS D&I metrics) -- paper soon to be released; included Evolution WG metrics to the dynamics of gender diversity and technical diversity in the OpenStack ecosystem.
        * The results are ongoing -- until published
        * Shared opinion and initial findings with Linux Foundation; meetings with Kate Stewart and Shuah 
        * Mixed method - observational, interviews, survey, mining software. 
            * Participant Observe: reasons WHY things happen the way they are happening
            * Interviews: WHY - inside perspetive from stakeholders
            * Mining repositories: to see activities -- very helpful of D&I WG and Evolution WG to know what to look for
        * See how different genders work in the OpenStack community
        * Study was done on onboarding phenomenon (independent variable)
* CHAOSScon NA 2020 cfp submission
    * 60 min workshops / tutorial
    * Goal is to have a hands-on experience for participants with the mixed-method, socio-technical analysis of ecosystem
    * How to structure the workshop:
        * (10min) Introduction
            * (5min) Presenters
            * (5min) CHAOSS working group focuses and objectives
        * (5min) Explain the difference between a project and ecosystem
            * Goal: understand that projects are not ecosystems
        * (10min) How do people adapt in software ecosystems (different from adapting in a project)
            * Goal: understand how metrics need to be different
        * (10min) Survey the different methods that have been used in different research studies
            * Goal: see importance of doing mixed method
        * (20min) Activity: Analyze an interview transcript. Maybe bring 1-page example. Form higher-level understanding.
            * (12min) Offer: Grounded Theory; Context analysis; approaches in this activity (one method per group, many groups)
            * Goal: become comfortable using interviews as a way to understand communities
            * (8min) Compare afterwards group results from GT and CA results
        * (included before) Discuss the kind of insights we get from qualitative analysis
        * (3min) Explain how to get quantitative data
        * (5min) Then discuss how the different data complement each other
        * (15min) Activity: analyzing quantitative data; we bring a 1-page summary of data we already collected and ask the participants to juxtaposition their qualitative findings with the quantitative findings we provide
            * Maybe ask participants to go online and find the highest contributor in any project they like
            * Goal: people will appreciate how the WHY and WHAT questions together provide a better picture
            * Report out
        * (5min) Wrap up
        * Total time: 83min
    * Next step:
        * **AI Armstrong: **Describe what to include in each part of the workshop
        * **AI Armstrong: **Decide on the metrics that would be valuable to this kind of analysis
        * **AI Armstrong: **Select case study for qualitative and quantitative data for the two activities
        * **AI Armstrong: **Write a CFP submission: description of the workshop

* Implementing Indeed.com API for the Living Wage: [Job Opportunities](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KN5p5SxIHP3ZYcNt8AKv8JpVRcagn5yTzL68VvFVKPY/edit#) metrics
    * Question:
        * Can we load historical data?
    * Option 1: GrimoireLab
        * Implementing the Indeed API in Perceval to collect data and output json
        * GrimoireELK needs to be made aware of the new data from Indeed
            * This is where we would do any kind of calculations and enrich the data.
        * Dashboard / Visualization: which is work we need to do in Kibiter
    * Option 2: Augur
        * Implement a worker to collect data from Indeed API and write into the database
        * don’t know what work is required to visualize the date...
        * Q: does the Augur schema metrics from from the Indeed API?
    * Next Steps:
        * Explore Augur - especially the schema (would it support our metric?)
* Social Currency Metric (Samantha from Socially Compute - Sentiment Analysis - Brand Value)
    * Maybe identify and describe it as a focus area.
    * **Next Step:** Working session for this was invited to on the mailing list. 
        * Tuesday 10/22, at 5pm CDT.
* Software - Building a proof-of-concept for parameterized metrics, using the example of [Labor Investment](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/blob/master/focus-areas/labor-investment/labor_investment.md).
    * It might be a Python script, bash script or Ruby script or web UI
    * One approach could be to use the GrimoireLab tool.
        * Step one, use the JSON Elasticsearch Response from the dashboard to build the metric
        * Step two, get the JSON from the Elasticsearch API, the query is formed from the GrimoireLab dashboard.
    * Design:
        * Get JSON or CSV
        * Load Data
        * Ask for parameters
        * Calculate metric
* Roadmap for next Metric release
    * Define Job Opportunity

# September 27, 2019

Attendees: Jon Lawrence, Matt Snell, Sean Goggins

Notes: 



* Release / No overlap from last meeting attendance. 
* Looks like living wage metrics need a little steam? Andy trying to put together
* Job opportunities: 
    * Searching open source projects on LinkedIN for Jobs? Are we talking about people who are using LinkedIN?  
    * Jon is asking for a sample query of the search results sought.
    * Languages are a common hiring filter; not so much a more narrow open source project. 
    * What about ZipRecruiter? 
        * [https://www.ziprecruiter.com/zipsearch](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/zipsearch)

Notes:



* Plan for next release. Release release by end of Nov 2019.
* Steering committee to get together
    * It’s easy to find people who represent corporate interests
    * It is harder to find metrics that support living wage metrics (or people who have this as their mission)
    * Maybe developer advocates may be more interested in this metric
        * SustainOSS
        * OpenCollective
        * GitCoin(?)
    * Software Freelancer Groups(?)
    * Proposed for steering committee

        Developer Evangelist from StackShare - Justin Dorfman

* Living Wage metrics
    * [https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/tree/master/focus-areas/living-wage](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/tree/master/focus-areas/living-wage)
    * If the main way to get paid is to be hired, then we need to focus on questions that are focused on chances to get hired.
    * Recruiting is a benefit that is mentioned repeatedly by organizations. The Living Wage metric is focused on the “labor” side (not “capital”).
* Job Opportunities
    * Simple metrics could be to search for the open source project in question on linkedin for jobs.

            **BoF: CHAOSS Value Metrics for Open Source Project Health** - _Andy Leak, CHAOSS; Matt Germonprez, University of Nebraska; Malvika Rao, Incentives Research; Georg Link, University of Nebraska; and Sean Goggins, University of Missouri_


            CHAOSS is a Linux Foundation project aimed at developing metrics, methodologies, and software for expressing open source project health and sustainability. By measuring open source project health and sustainability, CHAOSS seeks to improve the transparency and actionability of open source project health and sustainability so that relevant stakeholders can make more informed decisions about open source project engagement. In 2019, CHAOSS launched a Value Metrics Working Group. The birds-of-a-feather session is for current and future OSPO executive sponsors, open source program managers, open source maintainers, and open source contributors. In this session, you will learn about our first survey of value-oriented issues related to open source project health, see what companies are doing currently, and hear about industry trends. In this session we will make time for introductions and provide opportunities for community collaboration and networking.

        * Target Audience: OSPO Managers
        * Target Outcomes:
            * Education for the Attendees
            * Feedback for our Panelists
        * Matt to moderate session 
            * Potential questions include: 
                * What was the purpose of creating a working group related to value metrics? 
                * Could you talk about the existing value metrics and what the goal of those metrics can be? 
                * What does the future hold in the development of value metrics? 
                * Who are the primary stakeholders for value metrics? 
                * What are the cases or scenarios that we’re missing (to audience)? 
    * CHAOSScon session (20 mins)
        * [https://chaoss.community/CHAOSScon-2019-NA/](https://chaoss.community/CHAOSScon-2019-NA/)
        * DESCRIPTION:

            The CHAOSS Value Metrics Group started in Spring 2019. In this talk, we will describe the Value Metrics and how they relate to Open Source Program Offices. We will describe new software tools for measuring Economic Value, present the results of an email survey, and describe lessons learned in a series of interviews with Open Source Program Offices. We'll discuss next steps, and potential efforts to build connections between OSPO offices for networking and learning.

        * Focus on advancing what Value is in CHAOSS
        * Maybe 5 minutes on the metrics we released
        * 5 minutes on existing metric ideas
        * 10 minutes audience interaction with what they want to see.
* Status and direction / next steps
    * Metrics for 1.5 release (February)
    * Working implementation of Tools
        * http://value.augurlabs.com

Notes:



* Issue 27: Organizational User release metric
* Change the title of metric:
    * Organizational Project Skill Demand
        * +1 from Georg
        * +1 from Andy
* Rewriting question to: 
    * How many organizations are using this project and could hire me if I become proficient?
        * +1 from Andy
        * +1 from Georg
* Rewriting the description
    * Organizations engage with open source projects through use and dependencies. This metric is aimed at determining downstream demand of skills related to an open source project. This metric looks at organizations that deploy a project as part of an IT infrastructure, other open source projects with declared dependencies, and references to the project through social media, conference mentions, blog posts, and similar activities.
* Proposing a revised formula:
    * Base metrics include:
    * - Number of organizations that created issues for a project
    * - Number of organizations that created pull requests for a project
    * - Number of organizations that blog or tweet about a project
    * - Number of organizations that mention a project in open hiring requests
    * - Number of organizations that are represented at meetups about this project
    * - Number of other projects that are dependent on a project
    * - Number of books about a project
    * - Google search trends for a project
* Issue 29: Labor Investment
* Rewrite question:
    * What was the cost of an organization for its employees to create the counted contributions (e.g., commits, issues, and pull requests)?
* Rewriting formula to include more contribution types
    * Base metrics include:
    * 
    * - number of contributions
    * - number of contributions broken out by contributor types (internal / external)
    * - number of contributions broken out by contribution types (e.g., commits, issues, pull requests)
    * 
    * Parameters include:
    * 
    * - hourly labor rate
    * - average labor hours to create contribution (by contribution type)
    * 
    * Labor Investment = For each contribution type, sum (Number of contributions * Average labor hours to create contribution * Average hourly rate)

* Augur is working on processing repositories around value metrics including: 
    * Who committed 
    * Author of code 
    * Files edited
    * Lines added/removed for each commit for each file
    * Repos from: 
        * Rails 
        * Comcast
        *  GraphQL 
        * Netflix
        *  Apache 
* The intention is to take the output from Augur around these and provide a why to do hourly rate calculations on the fly. Value is derived from: 
    * Labor rate (parameter)
    * Complexity (parameterized as it varies language to language)
* Metrics Release

    * We want to occasionally brainstorm opportunities.
    * Weekly, we want to discuss about pursuing opportunities.
    * Maybe we will have a call to start writing grant proposal; Or maybe we can have one person who leads the grant writing.
    * NSF Grants may require University Professors to be primary on the grant and write into the budget support for open source project members as sub-contractors.
    * CommunityBridge may provide a way to ask for funding to support Value WG work.
    * Funding only in USA or also outside?
    * Different grant types:
        * Some grants are research oriented (e.g., NSF) - grants about something [academic funding] - very large, take a long time to assemble, require large team, is a ton of work to execute
        * Some grants are for something, e.g., scaling up [may be faster to assemble]
    * Comcast (Nithya Ruff) have a research fund
        * [https://innovationfund.comcast.com/](https://innovationfund.comcast.com/)
    * Mozilla Open Source Support Awards
        * [https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/moss/](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/moss/) 
    * Keep discussion in weekly meetings.

* Recurring time during calls for software implementation
    * We would like an instance of Augur
    * How would this be hosted? What would that require? What action items do we have?
    * Augur will be adding a feature to get lines of code by project and programming language.
    * **AI Sean:** Set up an instance of Augur with 4-6 repos for the Value Working Group. Target URL: [https://wg-value.augurlabs.io/](https://wg-value.augurlabs.io/) 
    * Augur README includes information for how to contribute.
    * Augur is collecting data using Facade to collect repo data, has a copy of GHTorrent database, uses the Libraries.io, calls APIs, and another primary data source.
    * The WG-Value Augur instance will be developed in a separate branch in the Augur repository.
* Document which metric(s) to focus on for upcoming release: [Level of Completeness Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_jwkwzs8s6SAm2vVY-8lzTQk3YT0YpOveTlKOwjd2eQ/edit#gid=700620500)

    * Working with GrimoireLab could be through the development of Panels that display value metrics
    * Working with Augur could be through fleshing out the Augur panel
        * E.g., [http://lf.augurlabs.io/singlegit/value/github.com%2FARMmbed%2Fmbed-os.git](http://lf.augurlabs.io/singlegit/value/github.com%2FARMmbed%2Fmbed-os.git)
        * **TODO: **Look at how code commits are done in the “GMD” tab. Replicate in Value tab.
    * How easy is it for users to input parameters that are important to them?
        * A low-fi implementation could be to allow exporting as CSV and then a user can have their formula in an Excel Spreadsheet.
        * Augur provides a JSON file, to be able to import it in Excel, we need to convert the data.
        * Idea 1: try [JQ](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/163845/using-jq-to-extract-values-and-format-in-csv) as a JSON -> CSV conversion tool 
        * Idea 2: [http://convertcsv.com/json-to-csv.htm](http://convertcsv.com/json-to-csv.htm) can convert the JSON to CSV. 
        * The CSV output can be imported to Excel.
        * **TODO: **Document the process in the VMG repository.
    * **TODO**: Explore parameterized metrics in Augur and Grimore-Labs (Kibana).
    * Value for developers. Potential “Living Wage” metrics:
        * [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NVkjESaKlSpNlLxlDqV6Yr_Zfbs_55doart41EfB0-Y/edit#](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NVkjESaKlSpNlLxlDqV6Yr_Zfbs_55doart41EfB0-Y/edit#)

        * Time duration for first response
        * See link for more…
        * **AI Georg: **Create pull request to add “Living Wage” questions to repository.
* Add VMG entries to ‘Level of Completeness’ spreadsheet that D&I had developed.
    * Level of completeness for VMG metrics is the same, no need to do the exercise.
    * VMG already determined to focus on the Labor Investment: Commit Count by Organization.
* Recurring time during calls for grants
    * We created grant tracking spreadsheet.
    * It is tracked through issue #19: [https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/issues/19](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/issues/19)

**April 12, 2019**

Agenda:



* Discuss: Software Development Workflow for Public Metrics
    * start with the simplest possible thing
    * commits by person and organization(?)
* Research Grants: Can we find opportunities for ValueMetrics-related Grant Proposals?

Video: [https://youtu.be/vEqGTKU6QLM](https://youtu.be/vEqGTKU6QLM) 

Notes: 



* Attendees: Venu Vardhan Reddy Tekula, Vinod Ahuja, Andy Leak, Sean Goggins, Kevin Lumbard, Georg Link, Matt Germonprez
* AI Georg: 
* Requirements documents for value metrics
    * To advance value metrics, we might choose to expand on one focus area at a time and get a front to back workflow working.
    * After deciding on one metric, start implementing it? Prioritize a working code over defining all focus areas?
    * Goal option 1 for WG: Put together requirements for metrics and let someone else do the implementation
    * Goal option 2 for WG: Build out a framework for value metrics that includes the requirements and working software. This includes a end-to-end flow of the software
        * Agreement exists for goal option 2. Putting pressure on metrics by implementing them in software is a preferred way to do it.
    * Focus areas: [https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/issues](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/issues)
    * FA “Labor Investment” [#14](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/issues/14)
        * Maybe count commits (put a dollar value on it?)
        * We work in the google doc to brainstorm ideas: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AJ-CA1gwXRuAeZYe6sKjBM9eaCPME1dGqWT5kRvroG0/edit#](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AJ-CA1gwXRuAeZYe6sKjBM9eaCPME1dGqWT5kRvroG0/edit#)
        * Augur already has the backend to support some of the basic metrics that we are talking about.
        * A phase 2 could be to allow parameterized metrics. Users of the metrics could add their assumptions, such as labor cost for commit/pull request/issue, to receive an estimate of labor cost for contributing
            * Assumptions could be collected anonymously to build out a database of common assumptions that companies can compare themselves with.
        * Implementation note: Issues and pull requests are not stored in a repository and will have to be calculated from a collaboration platform like GitHub or other issue trackers.
        * **AI Andy:** Create pull request to add the focus area to the Value WG repository.
        * As we build out the detail pages for the questions, we can use the Evolution WG template:
            * [https://github.com/chaoss/wg-gmd/blob/master/metrics/template_folder/A_template.md](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-gmd/blob/master/metrics/template_folder/A_template.md)
* Using value work to write grants?
    * Which agencies are interested in these economic issues?
    * [https://www.nsf.gov/dir/index.jsp?org=SBE](https://www.nsf.gov/dir/index.jsp?org=SBE)
    * Foundations tied to corporate sponsors?
    * Corporations?
    * NSF Science of Organizations
    * [https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5383&org=SBE&sel_org=SBE&from=fund](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5383&org=SBE&sel_org=SBE&from=fund)

        * Strong fit. 
    * We discussed funding strategy and process.
    * **AI Andy:** create a table on the GitHub repo to track funding opportunities
        * Table: Agency, Link, Description, Priority (direct hit vs. out of band)
    * Maybe look at what these programs have funded before to see what might fit with them

        * Codebase cost / code counting
        * Complexity measures
    * Focus Area: Ecosystem Value / Goal: Estimating the value of an open source project’s ecosystem (similar to market valuation)
        * Market Valuation
        * Enterprise Valuation
        * E.g., availability of add-on products; number of active users; installs, downloads of non-software artifacts; software downloads
    * Focus Area: Downstream Value / Goal: Estimate the value provided to other open source projects (down-stream value)
        * E.g., V-Index (this may be similar to or related to ecosystem value)
    * **AI Georg:** Create an issue with a google doc for each goal and share the list of goals/focus areas with chaoss mailing list.
* Why are companies interested in Value Metrics
    * Company competitiveness
    * Innovating faster
    * Building brand value
    * Rationalizing investment in open source
    * Comparing open source vs. in-house vs. outsourcing development
    * Recruiting
    * Why do I care / breakdown by stakeholder role
        * Sponsor, (e.g., CIO, open source program office)
        * Maintainer or leader in open source projects
        * Contributor
        * User of a software
* How do we see these ideas translating into something people can consume.
    * Software implementation?
    * Analytics tool?
    * Agnostic to how they are implemented?
    * Two paths:
        * a) Define agnostically, plan the implementation design.
        * b) Implement first and then define the metric later. (e.g., Augur is doing this with [COCOMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COCOMO))
    * We want to produce a list of metrics with a rudimentary description of how they can be calculated (similar to a requirements document).
    * We want to produce software implementations for allowing people to use a metric AND to learn more about the metric.
* How the CHAOSS Working Group works?
    * What does CHAOSS produce? - CHAOSS produces metrics and software implementations
        * GMD WG used Jupiter notebooks to plainly show how a metric is operationalized; tool implementors can use the notebook as a starting point for implementations
* Discussion about how to build out metrics in CHAOSS
* Discussion about collecting metrics
* Discussion about doing interviews to get feedback on metrics
* Value WG meets weekly on Friday at 11am CT.
* Facilitator for next time: Andy
    * **AI Andy:** Send meeting reminder to mailing list at least one day before meeting.
